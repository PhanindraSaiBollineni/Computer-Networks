<CENTER><h2>Network Security</h2></center>

<div align="left">
    <p align="left">Data on the network is analogous to possessions of a person. 
    It has to be kept secure from others with malicious intent. This intent 
    ranges from bringing down servers on the network to using people's private 
    information like credit card numbers to sabotage of major organizations with 
    a presence on a network. To secure data, one has to ensure that it makes 
    sense only to those for whom it is meant. This is the case for data 
    transactions where we want to prevent eavesdroppers from listening to and 
    stealing data. Other aspects of security involve protecting user data on a 
    computer by providing password restricted access to the data and maybe some 
    resources so that only authorized people get to use these,&nbsp; and identifying 
    miscreants and thwarting their attempts to cause damage to the network among 
    other things.</div>
  <div align="left"><p>
    The various issues in Network security are as follows :
  </div>

  <div align="left">
    
<ol>
      
<li><b>Authentication: </b>We have to check that the person who has 
      requested for something or has sent an e-mail is indeed allowed to do so. 
      In this process we will also look at how the person authenticates his 
      identity to a remote machine.
      <li><b>Integrity: </b>We have to check that the message which we have 
      received is indeed the message which was sent. Here CRC will not be enough 
      because somebody may deliberately change the data. Nobody along the route 
      should be able to change the data.
      <li><b>Confidentiality: </b>Nobody should be able to read the data on 
      the way so we need Encryption
      <li><b>Non-repudiation: </b>Once we sent a message, there should be no 
      way that we can deny sending it and we have to accept that we had sent it.
      <li><b>Authorization: </b>This refers to the kind of service which is 
      allowed for a particular client. Even though a user is authenticated we 
      may decide not to authorize him to use a particular service.
</ol>
      For authentication, if two persons know a secret then we just need to 
      prove that no third person could have generated the message. But for 
      Non-repudiation we need to prove that even the sender could not have 
      generated the message. So authentication is easier than Non-repudiation.
      To ensure all this, we take the help of cryptography. We can have two 
      kinds of encryption :
<ol>
      <li><b>Symmetric Key Encryption: </b>There is a single key which is shared between the two users and the same 
      key is used for encrypting and decrypting the message.
<li><b>Public Key Encryption: </b>There are two keys with each user : a public 
      key and a private key. The public key of a user is known to all but the 
      private key is not known to anyone except the owner of the key. If a user 
      encrypts a message in his private key then it can be decrypted by anyone 
      by using the sender's public key. To send a message securely, we encrypt 
      the message in the public key of the receiver which can only be decrypted 
      by the user with his private key.
</ol>
    <p>Symmetric key encryption is much faster and efficient in terms of 
    performance. But it does not give us Non-repudiation. And there is a problem 
    of how do the two sides agree on the key to be used assuming that the 
    channel is insecure ( others may snoop on our packet ). In symmetric key 
    exchange, we need some amount of public key encryption for authentication. 
    However, in public key encryption, we can send the public key in plain text 
    and so key exchange is trivial. But this does not authenticate anybody. So 
    along with the public key, there needs to be a certificate. Hence we would 
    need a public key infrastructure to distribute such certificates in the 
    world.</p>
    
<h3>Key Exchange in Symmetric Key Schemes</h3>
    
      We will first look at the case where we can use public key encryption 
      for this key exchange. . The sender first encrypts the message using the 
      symmetric key. Then the sender encrypts the symmetric key first using it's 
      private key and then using the receiver's public key. So we are doing the 
      encryption twice. If we send the certificate also along with this then we 
      have authentication also. So what we finally send looks like this :<p>
    
  </div>
<div align="center">
  <font size="4">Z :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certificate<sub>sender </sub>+ Public<sub>reciever
  </sub>( Private<sub>sender </sub>( E<sub>k</sub> ) ) + E<sub>k</sub> ( M )</font></div>

<p><div align="left">
  Here E<sub>k </sub>stands for the symmetric key and E<sub>k </sub>( M ) for 
  the message which has been encrypted in this symmetric key.<p>However this 
  still does not ensure integrity. The reason is that if there is some change in 
  the middle element, then we will not get the correct key and hence the message 
  which we decrypt will be junk. So we need something similar to CRC but 
  slightly more complicated. This is because somebody might change the CRC and 
  the message consistently. This function is called Digital Signature.</p>
  
    <h3>Digital Signatures</h3>
    Suppose A has to send a message to B. A computes a hash function of the 
    message and then sends this after encrypting it using its own private key. 
    This constitutes the signature produced by A. B can now decrypt it, 
    recompute the hash function of the message it has received and compare the 
    two. 
    Obviously, we would need the hash functions to be such that the 
    probability of two messages hashing to the same value is extremely low. 
    Also, it should be difficult to compute a message with the same hash 
    function as another given message. Otherwise any intruder could replace the 
    message with another that has the same hash value and leave the signatures 
    intact leading to loss of integrity. 
    So the message along with the digital signature looks like this :
  
</div>
<p align="center"><font size="4">Z + Private<sub>sender </sub>( Hash ( M ) )</font></p>
<div align="left">
  

<h3>Digital Certificates</h3>
  In addition to using the public key we would like to have a guarantee of 
  talking to a known person. We assume that there is an entity who is entrusted 
  by everyone and whose public key is known to everybody. This entity gives a 
  certificate to the sender having the sender's name, some other information and 
  the sender's public key. This whole information is encrypted in the private 
  key of this trusted entity. A person can decrypt this message using the public 
  key of the trusted authority. But how can we be sure that the public key of 
  the authority is correct ?
  &nbsp;
  In this respect Digital signatures are like I-Cards. Let us ask ourselves 
  the question : How safe are we with I-Cards? Consider a situation where you go 
  to the bank and need to prove your identity. I-Card is used as a proof of your 
  identity. It contains your signature. How does the bank know you did not make 
  the I-Card yourselves? It needs some proof of that and in the case of I-Cards 
  they contain a counter signature by the director for the purpose. Now how does 
  the bank know the signature I claim to be of the director indeed belongs to 
  him? Probably the director will also have an I-Card with a counter signature 
  of a higher authority. Thus we will get a chain of signing authorities. Thus 
  in addition to signing we need to prove that the signatures are genuine and 
  for that purpose we would probably use multiple I-Cards each carrying a higher 
  level of signature-counter signature pair.
</div>

  So in order to distribute the public key of this authority we use 
  certificates of higher authority and so on. Thus we get a tree structure where 
  the each node needs the certificates of all nodes above it on the path to the 
  root in order to be trusted. But at some level in the tree the public key 
  needs to be known to everybody and should be trusted by everybody too.<br>
