<center><h2>Transport Layer Protocol- Implementation Issues</h2></center>
In this class we discussed about the TCP from the implementation point of view and addressed various issues like 
state diagram and other details which TCP Standard does not define but supported by commercial implementations.
<h3>
State Diagram</h3>
The state diagram approach to view the TCP connection establishment and closing simplifies the design of TCP
implementation. The idea is to represent the TCP connection state, which progresses from one state to other as
various messages are exchanged. To simplify the matter, we considered two state diagrams, viz., for  TCP connection
establishment and TCP connection closing.
<br>
Fig 1 shows the state diagram for the TCP connection establishment and associated table briefly explains each state.

The table gives brief description of each state of the above diagram. 
<center><TABLE BORDER COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" NOSAVE >
<CAPTION>State Description Table 1.</CAPTION>

<TR NOSAVE>
<TD WIDTH="25%" NOSAVE>Listen</TD>

<TD>Represents the state when waiting for connection request from any remote
host and port. This specifically applies to a Server.&nbsp;

<P>From this state, the server can close the service or actively open a
connection by sending SYN.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Syn-Sent</TD>

<TD>Represents waiting for a matching for a connection request after having
sent a connection request. This applies to both server and client side.
Even though server is considered as the one with passive open, it can also
send a SYN packet actively.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Syn_Rcvd</TD>

<TD>Represents waiting for a confirmation connection request acknowledgment
after having both received and sent connection request.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Estab</TD>

<TD>Represents an open connection. Data transfer can take place from this
point onwards.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></center>
&nbsp;
 

<P>After the connection has been established, two end-points will exchange
useful information and terminate the connection. Fig. 2 shows the state
diagram for terminating an active connection.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<TR NOSAVE>
<TD WIDTH="25%" NOSAVE>FIN-WAIT-1</TD>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD>FIN-WAIT-2</TD>

<TD>Represents waiting for a connection termination request from the remote
TCP.&nbsp;

TCP.&nbsp;

<TR>
<TD>TIME_WAIT</TD>

<TD>This represents waiting time enough for the packets to reach their
destination. This waiting time is usually 4 min.&nbsp;

</TR>

<TR>
<TD>CLOSE_WAIT</TD>

<TD>Represents a state when the server receives a FIN from the remote TCP
, sends ACK and issues close call sending FIN&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>LAST_ACK</TD>

<TD>Represents waiting for an ACK for the previously sent FIN-ACK to the
remote TCP&nbsp;

<TD>Represents a closed TCP connection having received all the ACKs&nbsp;

<h3>
Other implementation details</h3>
<H4>
Quite Time</H4>
It might happen that a host currently in communication crashes
and reboots. At startup time, all the data structures and timers will be
reset to an initial value. To make sure that earlier connection packets
are gracefully rejected, the local host is not allowed to make any new
connection for a small period at startup. This time will be set in accordance
with reboot time of the operating system.

<H4>
Initial Sequence number :</H4>
Initial sequence number used in the TCP communication will
be&nbsp; initialized at boot time randomly, rather than to 0. This is to
ensure that packets from old connection should not interfere with a new
connection. So the recommended method is to

<ul>
<li>Initialize the ISN at boot time by a random number
<li>For every 500 ms, increment ISN by 64K
<li>With every SYN received, increment ISN by 64K
</UL>


<H4>
Maximum Request backlog at server</H4>

As we have seen in Unix Networking programming, <I>listen(sd,n),&nbsp;
</I>sets a maximum to the number of requests to be obliged by the server
at any time. So if there are already n requests for connection, and n+1
request comes, two things can be done.
<UL>
<LI>
Drop the packet silently</LI>

<LI>
Ask the peer to send the request later.</LI>
</UL>
The first option is recommended here because, the assumption is that this
queue for request is a coincident and some time later, the server should
be free to process the new request. Hence if we drop the packet, the client
will go through the time-out and retransmission and server will be free
to process it.

<P>Also, Standard TCP does not define any strategy/option of knowing who
requested the connection. Only Solaris 2.2 supports this option.
<H4>
Delayed Acknowledgment</H4>

 TCP will piggyback the acknowledgment with its data. But if
the peer does not have the any data to send at that moment, the acknowledgment
should not be delayed too long. Hence a timer for 200 ms will be used.
At every 200 ms, TCP will check for any acknowledgment to be sent and send
them as individual packets.
<H4>
Small packets</H4>

 TCP implementation discourages small packets. Especially if
a previous relatively large packet has been sent and no acknowledgment
has been received so far, then this small packet will be stored in the
buffer until the situation improves.

<P>But there are some applications for which delayed data is worse than
bad data. For example, in <I>telnet, </I>each key stroke will be processed&nbsp;

by the server and hence no delay should be introduced. As we have seen
in Unix Networking programming, options for the socket can be set as NO_DELAY,
so that small packets are not discouraged.
<H4>
ICMP Source Quench</H4>

 We have seen in ICMP that ICMP Source Quench message will be
send for the peer to slow down. Some implementations discard this message,
but few set the <B>current window size</B> to 1.
<BR>But this is not a very good idea.
<BR>
<H4>
Retransmission Timeout</H4>

 In some implementation (E.g.. Linux),
 RTO = RTT + 4 * delay variance</BLOCKQUOTE>
is used to instead of constant 2.

<P>Also instead of calculating RTT(est) from the scratch, cache will be
used to store the history from which new values are calculated as discussed
in the previous classes.

<P>Standard values for Maximum Segment Life (MSL)&nbsp; will be between
0.5 to 2 minutes and
Time wait state = f(MSL)


<H4>
Keep Alive Time</H4>

Another important timer in TCP is keep alive timer. It is basically
used by a TCP peer&nbsp; to check whether the other end is up or down.
It periodically checks this connection. If&nbsp; the other end did not
respond, then that connection will be closed.

<H4>
Persist Timer</H4>

As we saw in TCP window management, when source sends one full
window of packets, it will&nbsp; set its window size to 0 and expects an
ACK from remote TCP&nbsp; to increase its window size. Suppose such an
ACK has been sent and is lost. Hence source will have current window size
= 0 and cannot send &amp; destination is expecting next byte. To avoid
such a deadlock, a Persist Timer will be used. When this timer goes off,
the source will send the last one byte again. So we hope that situation
has improved and an ACK to increase the current window size will be received.
