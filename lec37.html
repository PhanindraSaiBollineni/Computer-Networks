<CENTER><h2>Network File System (NFS)</h2></center>
Network File System ( NFS ) is a distributed file system ( DFS ) developed
by Sun Microsystems. This allows directory structures to be spread over the  net-
worked computing systems. 

 <p>      A DFS is a file system whose clients, servers and  storage devices are dis-
persed among the machines of distributed system. A file system provides a set of
file operations like read, write, open, close, delete etc. which forms the file
services. The clients are provided with these file services. The basic features of
DFS are multiplicity and autonomy of clients and servers.
 
 <p>       NFS follows the directory structure almost same as that in non-NFS system but
there are some differences between them with respect to:
<ul>
<li>Naming
<li>Path Names
<li>Semantics
</uL>

<h3>Naming</h3>
Naming is a mapping between logical and physical objects. For example, users
refers to a file by a textual name, but it is mapped to disk blocks. There are two
notions regarding name mapping used in DFS. 
<ul>
<li><b>Location Transparency: </b>The name of a file does not give any hint of file's physical storage location.
<li><b>Location Independence: </b>The name of a file does not need to be changed when file's  physical storage location changes. 
</ul>
</ul>
A location independent naming scheme is basically a dynamic mapping. NFS does
not support location independency.<p>
There are three major naming schemes used in DFS. In the simplest approach,
files are named by some combination of machine or host name and the path name. This
naming scheme is neither location independent nor location transparent. This may be
used in server side. Second approach is to attach or mount the remote directories to
the local directories. This gives an appearance of a coherent directory. This scheme
is used by NFS. Early NFS allowed only previously mounted remote directories. But
with the advent of automount , remote directories are mounted on demand based on the
table of mount points and file structure names. This has other advantages like the
file-mount table size is much smaller and for each mount point, we can specify many
servers. The third approach of naming is to use name space which is identical to all
machines. In practice, there are many special files that make this approach difficult to implement.

<h3>Mounting</h3>
The mount protocol is used to establish the initial logical connection between a server and a client. A mount operation includes the name of the remote directory to be mounted and the name of the server machine storing it. The server maintains an export list which specifies local file system that it exports for mounting along with the permitted machine names. Unix uses /etc/exports for this purpose.
Since, the list has a maximum length, NFS is limited in scalabilty. Any directory
within an exported file system can be mounted remotely on a machine. When the server
receives a mount request, it returns a file handle to the client. File handle is
basically a data-structure of length 32 bytes. It serves as the key for further access to files within the mounted system. In Unix term, the file handle consists of
a file system identifier that is stored in super block and an inode number to identify the exact mounted directory within the exported file system. In NFS, one
new field is added in inode that is called the generic number. 

<p>Mount can be is of three types - 
<ol>
<li><b>Soft mount: </b>A time bound is there.
<li><b>Hard mount: </b>No time bound.
<li><b>Automount: </b>Mount operation done on demand.
</ol>

<h3>NFS Protocol and Remote Operations</h3>
The NFS protocol provides a set of RPCs for remote operations like <b>lookup,
create, rename, getattr, setattr, read, write, remove, mkdir</b> etc. The procedures can
be invoked only after a file handle for the remotely mounted directory has been esta-
blished. NFS servers are stateless servers. A stateless file server avoids to keep
state informations by making each request self-contained. That is, each request iden-
tifies the file and the position of the file in full. So, the server needs not to
store file pointer. Moreover, it needs not to establish or terminate a connection by
opening a file or closing a file, repectively. For reading a directory, NFS does not
use any file pointer, it uses a <b>magic cookie</b>. 
<p>
 Except the opening and closing a file, there is almost one-to-one mapping
between Unix system calls for file operations and the NFS protocol RPCs. A remote
file operation can be translated directly to the corresponding RPC. Though conceptu-
ally, NFS adheres to the remote service paradigm, in practice, it uses buffering and
caching. File blocks and attributes are fetched by RPCs and cached locally. Future
remote operations use the cached data, subject to consistency constraints.
<p>
Since, NFS runs on RPC and RPC runs on UDP/IP which is unreliable, operations
should be idempotent.

<h3>Cache Update Policy</h3>
The policy used to write modified data blocks to the server's master copy has
critical effect on the system performance and reliability. The simplest policy is to
<b>write through</b> the disk as soon as they are placed on any cache. It's advantageous
because it ensures the reliability but it gives poor performance. In server site
this policy is often followed. Another policy is <b>delayed write</b>. It does not ensure
reliability. Client sites can use this policy. Another policy is <b>write-on-close</b>. It
is a variation of delayed write. This is used by Andrews File System (AFS). 
<p>
In NFS, clients use delayed write. But they don't free delayed written block
until the server confirms that the data have been written on disk. So, here, Unix
semantics are not preserved. NFS does not handle client crash recovery like Unix. Since, servers in NFS are stateless, there is no need to handle server crash recovery also.
 
<h3>Time Skew</h3>
Because of differences of time at server and client, this problem occures.
This may lead to problems in performing some operations like " make ".

<h3>Performance Issues</h3>
To increase the reliability and system performance, the following things
are generally done. 
<ol>
<li>Cache, file blocks and directory informations are maintained. 

<li>All attributes of file / directory are cached. These stay 3 sec. for files and 30 sec. for directory. 

<li>For large caches, bigger block size ( 8K ) is benificial. 
</ol>
This is a brief description of NFS version 2. NFS version 3 has already been come
out and this new version is an enhancement of the previous version. It removes many
of the difficulties and drawbacks of NFS 2.<br>

<center><h2>Andrews File System (AFS)</h2></center>

AFS is a distributed file system, with scalability as a major goal.
Its efficiency can be attributed to the following practical assumptions
(as also seen in UNIX file system):
<ul>
<li>
Files are small (i.e. entire file can be cached)</li>

<li>
Frequency of reads much more than those of writes</li>

<li>
Sequential access common</li>

<li>
Files are not shared (i.e. read and written by only one user)</li>

<li>
Shared files are usually not written</li>

<li>
Disk space is plentiful</li>
</ul>
AFS distinguishes between client machines (workstations) and dedicated
server machines. Caching files in the client side cache reduces computation
at the server side, thus enhancing performance. However, the problem of
sharing files arises. To solve this, all clients with copies of a file
being modified by another client are not informed the moment the client
makes changes. That client thus updates its copy, and the changes are reflected
in the distributed file system only after the client closes the file. Various
terms related to this concept in AFS are:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Whole File Serving</b>: The entire file is transferred in one go, limited
only by the maximum size UDP/IP supports</li>

<li>
<b>Whole File Caching</b>: The entire file is cached in the local machine
cache, reducing file-open latency, and frequent read/write requests to
the server</li>

<li>
<b>Write On Close</b>: Writes are propagated to the server side copy only
when the client closes the local copy of the file</li>
</ul>
In AFS, the server keeps track of which files are opened by which clients
(as was not in the case of NFS). In other words, AFS has <b>stateful servers</b>,
whereas NFS has <b>stateless servers</b>. Another difference between the
two file systems is that AFS provides <b>location independence</b> (the
physical storage location of the file can be changed, without having to
change the path of the file, etc.) as well as <b>location transparency</b>
(the file name does not hint at its physical storage location). But as
was seen in the last lecture, NFS provides only location transparency.
Stateful servers in AFS allow the server to inform all clients with open
files about any updates made to that file by another client, through what
is known as a <b>callback</b>. Callbacks to all clients with a copy of
that file is ensured as a <b>callback promise</b> is issued by the server
to a client when it requests for a copy of a file.
<p>The key software components in AFS are:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Vice</b>: The server side process that resides on&nbsp; top of the unix
kernel, providing shared file services to each client</li>

<li>
<b>Venus</b>: The client side cache manager which acts as an interface
between the application program and the Vice</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<p>All the files in AFS are distributed among the servers. The set of files
in one server is referred to as a <b>volume</b>. In case a request can
not be satisfied from this set of files, the vice server informs the client
where it can find the required file.
<p>The basic file operations can be described more completely as:
<ul>
<li>
Open a file: Venus traps application generated file open system calls,
and checks whether it can be serviced locally (i.e. a copy of the file
already exists in the cache) before requesting Vice for it. It then returns
a file descriptor to the calling application. Vice, along with a copy of
the file, transfers a callback promise, when Venus requests for a file.</li>

<li>
Read and Write: Reads/Writes are done from/to the cached copy.</li>

<li>
Close a file: Venus traps file close system calls and closes the cached
copy of the file. If the file had been updated, it informs the Vice server
which then replaces its copy with the updated one, as well as issues callbacks
to all clients holding callback promises on this file. On receiving a callback,
the client discards its copy, and works on this fresh copy.</li>
</ul>
The server wishes to maintain its states at all times, so that no information
is lost due to crashes. This is ensured by the Vice which writes the states
to the disk. When the server comes up again, it also informs all the servers
about its crash, so that information about updates may be passed to it.
<p>A client may issue an open immediately after it issued a close (this
may happen if it has recovered from a crash very quickly). It will wish
to work on the same copy. For this reason, Venus waits a while (depending
on the cache capacity) before discarding copies of closed files. In case
the application had not updated the copy before it closed it, it may continue
to work on the same copy. However, if the copy had been updated, and the
client issued a file open after a certain time interval (say 30 seconds),&nbsp;
it will have to ask the server the last modification time, and accordingly,
request for a new copy. For this, the clocks will have to be synchronized.
