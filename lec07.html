<center><h2>IEEE 802.5: Token Ring Network</h2></center><p>

<ul>
<li>Token Ring is formed by the nodes connected in ring format as shown in the diagram below. The principle used  in the token ring network is that a token is circulating in the ring and whichever node grabs that token will have right to transmit the data.  
<li>Whenever a station wants to transmit a frame it inverts a single bit of the 3-byte token which instantaneously changes it into a normal data packet. Because there is only one token, there can atmost be one transmission at a time.  
<li>Since the token rotates in the ring  it is guarenteed that every node gets the token with in some specified time. So there is an upper bound on the time of waiting to grab the token so that starvation is avoided. 
<li>There is also an upper limit of 250 on the number of nodes in the network. 
<li>To distinguish the normal data packets from token (control packet) a special sequence is assigned to the token packet. When any node gets the token it first sends the data it wants to send, then recirculates the token.
</ul>

</center>

<p>
If a node transmits the token and nobody wants to send the data the token comes back to the sender. If the first bit of the token reaches the sender before the transmission of the last bit, then error situation araises. So to avoid this we should have:
<p>
<center>
<b>
propogation delay + transmission of n-bits (1-bit delay in each node ) > transmission of the token time
</b>
</center>
<br>
A station may hold the token for the token-holding time.  which is 10 ms unless the installation sets a different value. If there is enough time left after the first frame has been transmitted to send more frames, then these frames may be sent as well. After all pending frames have been transmitted  or the transmission frame would exceed the token-holding time, the station regenerates the 3-byte token frame and puts it back on the ring.
<p>
<h3>Modes of Operation</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Listen Mode: </b>In this mode the node listens to the data and  transmits the data to the next node. In this  mode there is a one-bit delay associated with the transmission.
<br>
<center>
<img src="fig.lec07/listen.jpg">
</center>
<br>
<li><b>Transmit Mode: </b>In this mode the node just discards the any data and puts the data onto the network.
<br>
<center>
<img src="fig.lec07/transmit.jpg">
</center>
<br>
<li><b>By-pass Mode: </b>In this mode  reached when the node is down. Any data is just bypassed. There is no one-bit delay in this mode.

<h3>Token Ring Using Ring Concentrator</h3>
<br>
<center>
<img src="fig.lec07/trhubani.gif">
</center>
<br>
One problem with a ring network is that if the cable breaks somewhere, the ring dies. This problem is elegantly addressed by using a ring concentrator. A Token Ring concentrator simply changes the topology from a physical ring to a star wired ring. But the network still remains a ring logically. Physically, each station is connected to the ring concentrator (wire center) by a cable containing at least two twisted pairs, one for data to the station and one for data from the station. The Token still circulates around the network and is still controlled in the same manner, however, using a hub or a switch greatly improves reliability because the hub can automatically bypass any ports that are disconnected or have a cabling fault. This is done by having bypass relays inside the concentrator that are energized by current from the stations. If the ring breaks or station goes down, loss of the drive current will release the relay and bypass the station. The ring can then continue operation with the bad segment bypassed.

<h3>Who should remove the packet from the ring ?</h3>
There are 3 possibilities-</p> 
 
  <ol>
    <li><b>The source itself removes the packet after one full round in the ring</b>.
    <li><b>The destination removes it after accepting it</b>: This has two
      potential problems. Firstly, the solution won't work for broadcast or
      multicast, and secondly, there would be no way to acknowledge the sender
      about the receipt of the packet.
    <li><b>Have a specialized node only to discard packets</b>: This is a bad
      solution as the specialized node would know that the packet has been
      received by the destination only when it receives the packet the second
      time and by that time the packet may have actually made about one and half
      (or almost two in the worst case) rounds in the ring.
  
  </ol>
<p>
Thus the first solution is adopted with the source itself removing the packet
from the ring after a full one round. With this scheme, broadcasting and
multicasting can be handled as well as the destination can acknowledge the
source about the receipt of the packet (or can tell the source about some
error).

<h4>Data Format:</h4>
<P>No upper limit on amount of data as such, but it is limited by the token
holding time.

<h4>Checksum:</h4>

value. If the two are different, it indicates an error, otherwise the data may
be correct.

<h4>Frame Status:</h4>
<P>It contains the A and C bits.<P><b>A bit set to 1: destination recognized the
packet.<BR>C bit set to 1: destination accepted the packet.</b><P>This
arrangement provides an automatic acknowledgement for each frame. The A and C
bits are present twice in the Frame Status to increase reliability in as much as
they are not covered by the checksum.<b>
