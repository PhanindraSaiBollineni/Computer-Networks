<h3>
Data Conversion</h3>
<p>There is a possibility of having computers of different architectures in the 
same network. For e.g. we may have DEC or Intel machines ( which use 
Little-endian representation) connected with IBM or Motorola PCs (which use 
Big-endian representation) . Now a message from an Intel machine, sent in 
Little-endian order, may be interpreted by an IBM machine in Big-endian format. 
This will obviously give erroneous results. So we must have some strategy to 
convert data from one machine's native format to the other one's or, to some 
standard network format. </p>
<p><font color="#993300"><b>Available Methods :</b></font> </p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><b><i>Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1) : </i></b>This is the notation 
    developed by the ISO, to describe the data structures used in communication, 
    in a flexible yet standard enough way. The basic idea is to define all the 
    data structure types ( i.e., data types) needed by each application in ASN.1 
    and package them together in a <b>module</b>. When an application wants to 
    transmit a data structure, it can pass the data structure to the 
    presentation layer, along with the ASN.1 name of the data structure. Using 
    the ASN.1 definition as a guide, the presentation layer then knows what the 
    types and sizes of the fields are, and thus know how to encode them for 
    transmission (<i> Explicit Typing</i>). It can be implemented with 
    Asymmetric or Symmetric data conversion.
    <p></li>

    <li><b><i>External Data Representation (XDR) : </i></b>This is implemented 
    using Symmetric data representation. XDR is the standard representation used 
    for data traversing the network. XDR provides representations for most of 
    the structures that a C-program can specify. However the encodings contain 
    only data items and not information about their types. Thus, client and 
    servers using XDR must agree on the exact format of messages that they will 
    exchange (<i> Implicit Typing </i>). <br>
    The chief advantage lies in flexibility: neither the server nor the client 
    need to understand the architecture of the other. But, computational 
    overhead is the main disadvantage. Nevertheless, it simplifies programming, 
    reduces errors, increases interoperability among programs and makes easier 
    network management and debugging. <br>
    <i>The Buffer Paradigm : </i>XDR uses a buffer paradigm which requires a 
    program to allocate a buffer large enough to hold the external 
    representation of a message and to add items (i.e., fields) one at a time. 
    Thus a complete message is created in XDR format. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</h3>
<p>RPC comes under the Application-Oriented Design, where the client-server 
communication is in the form of Procedure Calls. We call the machine making the 
procedure call as <i>client</i> and the machine executing the called procedure 
as <i>server</i>. For every procedure being called there must exist a piece of 
code which knows which machine to contact for that procedure. Such a piece of 
code is called a <i>Stub</i>. On the client side, for every procedure being 
called we need a unique stub. However, the stub on the server side can be more 
general; only one stub can be used to handle more than one procedures (see 
figure ). Also, two calls to the same procedure can be made using the same stub.
</p>
<p></p>
<center>
<img src="fig.lec26/fig1.gif">
</center>
<p>Now let us see how a typical remote procedure call gets executed :- </p>
<p></p>
<center>
<p>
<img src="fig.lec26/rpc.gif">
</center>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Client program calls the stub procedure linked within its own address 
    space. It is a normal local call. </li>
    <li>The client stub then collects the parameters and packs them into a 
    message (<i>Parameter Marshalling</i>). The message is then given to the 
    transport layer for transmission. </li>

    <li>The transport entity just attaches a header to the message and puts it 
    out on the network without further ado. </li>
    <li>When the message arrives at the server the transport entity there passes 
    it tot the server stub, which unmarshalls the parameters. </li>
    <li>The server stub then calls the server procedure, passing the parameters 
    in the standard way. </li>
    <li>After it has completed its work, the server procedure returns, the same 
    way as any other procedure returns when it is finished. A result may also be 
    returned. </li>
    <li>The server stub then marshalls the result into a message and hands it 
    off at the transport interface. </li>
    <li>The reply gets back to the client machine. </li>

    <li>The transport entity hands the result to the client stub. </li>
    <li>Finally, the client stub returns to its caller, the client procedure, 
    along-with the value returned by the server in step 6. </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This whole mechanism is used to give the client procedure the illusion that 
it is making a direct call to a distant server procedure. To the extent the 
illusion exceeds, the mechanism is said to be <b>transparent</b>. But the 
transparency fails in <i>parameter passing</i>. Passing any data ( or data 
structure) by value is OK, but passing parameter 'by reference' causes problems. 
This is because the pointer in question here, points to an address in the 
address space of the client process, and this address space is not shared by the 
server process. So the server will try to search the address pointed to by this 
passed pointer, in its own address space. This address may not have the value 
same as that on the client side, or it may not lie in the server process' 
address space, or such an address may not even exist in the server address 
space. </p>
<p>One solution to this can be <b>Copy-in Copy-out</b>. What we pass is the 
value of the pointer, instead of the pointer itself. A local pointer, pointing 
to this value is created on the server side (<i>Copy-in</i>). When the server 
procedure returns, the modified 'value' is returned, and is copied back to the 
address from where it was taken (<i>Copy-out</i>). But this is disadvantageous 
when the pointer involved point to huge data structures. Also this approach is 
not foolproof. Consider the following example ( C-code) : </p>

<p></p>
<center>
<p>
<img src="fig.lec26/prog.gif" width="473" height="205"></p>
</center>
<p>The procedure 'myfunction()' resides on the server machine. If the program 
executes on a single machine then we must expect the output to be '4'. But when 
run in the client-server model we get '3'. Why ? Because 'x, and 'y' point to 
different memory locations with the same value. Each then increments its own 
copy and the incremented value is returned. Thus '3' is passed back and not '4'.
</p>
<p>Many RPC systems finesse the whole problem by prohibiting the use of 
reference parameters, pointers, function or procedure parameters on remote calls 
(<b>Copy-in</b>). This makes the implementation easier, but breaks down the 
transparency. </p>
<b>Protocol :</b>
<blockqoute />Another key implementation issue is the protocol to be used - TCP 
or UDP. If TCP is used then there may be problem in case of network breakdown. 
No problem occurs if the breakdown happens before client sends its request 
(client will be notified of this), or after the request is sent and the reply is 
not received ( time-out will occur). In case the breakdown occurs just after the 
server has sent the reply, then it won't be able to figure out whether its 
response has reached the client or not. This could be devastating for bank 
servers, which need to make sure that their reply has in fact reached to the 
client ( probably an ATM machine). So UDP is generally preferred over TCP, in 
making remote procedure calls. </p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b>Idempotent Operations:</b>
<blockquote>
  <p>If the server crashes, in the middle of the computation of a procedure on 
  behalf of a client, then what must the client do? Suppose it again sends its 
  request, when the server comes up. So some part of the procedure will be 
  re-computed. It may have instructions whose repeated execution may give 
  different results each time. If the side effect of multiple execution of the 
  procedure is exactly the same as that of one execution, then we call such 
  procedures as <b>Idempotent Procedures</b>. In general, such operations are 
  called <b>Idempotent Operations</b>. </p>
  <p>For e.g. consider ATM banking. If I send a request to withdraw Rs. 200 from 
  my account and some how the request is executed twice, then in the two 
  transactions of 'withdrawing Rs. 200' will be shown, whereas, I will get only 
  Rs. 200. Thus 'withdrawing is a non-idempotent operation. Now consider the 
  case when I send a request to 'check my balance'. No matter how many times is 
  this request executed, there will arise no inconsistency. This is an 
  idempotent operation. </p>
</blockquote>
<b>Semantics of RPC :</b>

<blockquote>
  <p>If all operations could be cast into an idempotent form, then time-out and 
  retransmission will work. But unfortunately, some operations are inherently 
  non-idempotent (e.g., transferring money from one bank account to another ). 
  So the exact semantics of RPC systems were categorized as follows: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Exactly once :</i></font> Here every call is 
    carried out 'exactly once', no more no less. But this goal is unachievable 
    as after a server crash it is impossible to tell that a particular operation 
    was carried out or not. </li>
    <li><i>At most once :</i></font> when this form is 
    used control always returns to the caller. If everything had gone right, 
    then the operation will have been performed exactly once. But, if a server 
    crash is detected, retransmission is not attempted, and further recovery is 
    left up to the client. </li>
    <li><i>At least once :</i></font> Here the client stub 
    keeps trying over and over, until it gets a proper reply. When the caller 
    gets control back it knows that the operation has been performed one or more 
    times. This is ideal for idempotent operations, but fails for non-idempotent 
    ones. </li>

    <li><i>Last of many :</i></font> This a version of 'At 
    least once', where the client stub uses a different transaction identifier 
    in each retransmission. Now the result returned is guaranteed to be the 
    result of the final operation, not the earlier ones. So it will be possible 
    for the client stub to tell which reply belongs to which request and thus 
    filter out all but the last one. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>

SUN RPC Model</h3>
The basic idea behind Sun RPC was to implement NFS (Network File
System). Sun RPC extends the remote procedure call model by defining a
remote execution enviroment. It defines a <b><i>remote program</i></b>
at the server side as the basic unit of software that executes on a remote
machine. Each remote program consists of one or more remote procedures
and global data. The global data is static data and all the procedures
inside a remote program share access to its global data. The figure below
illustrates the conceptual organization of three remote procedures in a
single remote program.

<center>
<p><img SRC="fig.lec26/sunrpc.gif"></center>

<p>Sun RPC allows both TCP and UDP for communication between remote procedures
and programs calling them. It uses the at least once semantic i.e., the
remote procedure is executed at least once. It uses copy-in method of parameter
passing but does not support copy-out style. It uses XDR for data representation.
It does not handle orphans(which are servers whose corresponding clients
have died). Thus if a client gives a request to a server for execution
of a remote procedure and eventually dies before accepting the results,
the server does not know whom to reply. It also uses a tool called <b><i>rpcgen</i></b>
to generate stubs automatically.
<p>Let us suppose that a client (say client1) wants to execute procedure
P1(in the figure above). Another client (say client2) wants to execute
procedure P2(in the figure above). Since both P1 and P2 access common global
variables they must be executed in a mutually exclusive manner. Thus in
view of this Sun RPC provides mutual exclusion by default i.e. no two procedures
in a program can be active at the same time. This introduces some amount
of delay in the execution of procedures, but mutual exclusion is a more
fundamental and important thing to provide, without it the results may
go wrong.
<p>Thus we see that anything which can be a threat to application programmers,
is provided by SUN RPC.
<h3>
How A Client Invokes A Procedure On Another Host</font></h3>
<font color="#000000">The remote procedure is a part of a program
executing in a remote host. Thus we would have to properly locate the host,
the program in it, and the procedure in the program. Each host can be specified
by a unique 32-bit integer. SUN RPC standard specifies that each remote
program executing on a computer must be assigned a unique 32-bit integer
that the caller uses to identify it. Furthermore, Sun RPC assigns a 32-bit
integer identifier for each remote procedure inside a given remote program.
The procedures are numbered sequentially: 1, 2, ...., N. To help ensure
that program numbers defined by separate organizations do not conflict,
Sun RPC has divided the set of program numbers into eight groups.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">Thus it seems sufficient that if we are able to
locate the host, the program in the host, and the procedure in the program,
we would be able to uniquely locate the remote procedure which is to be
executed.</font>
<h3>
Accommodating Multiple Versions Of A Remote Program</h3>
<font color="#000000">Suppose somebody wants to change the version
of a remote procedure in a remote program. Then as per the identification
method described above, he or she would have to make sure that the newer
version is compatible with the older one. This is a bottleneck on the server
side. Sun RPC provides a solution to this problem. In addition to a program
number, Sun RPC includes a 32-bit integer <b><i>version number</i></b>
for each remote program. Usually, the first version of a program is assigned
version 1. Later versions each receive a unique version number.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">Version numbers provide the ability to change
the details of a remote procedure call without obtaining a new program
number. Now, the newer client and the older client are disjoint, and no
compatibility is required between the two. When no request comes for the
older version for a pretty long time, it is deleted. Thus, in practice,
each RPC message identifies the intended recipient on a given computer
by a triple:</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(program number, version number, procedure number)</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Thus it is possible to migrate from one version
of a remote procedure to another gracefully and to test a new version of
the server while an old version of the server continues to operate.</font>
<h3>
Mapping A Remote Program To A Protocol Port</h3>
<font color="#000000">At the bottom of every communication in the
RPC model there are transport protocols like UDP and TCP. Thus every communication
takes place with the help of sockets. Now, how does the client know to
which port to connect to the server? This is a real problem when we see
that we cannot have a standard that a particular program on a particular
host should communicate through a particular port. Because the program
number is 32 bit and we can have 2<sup>32</sup> programs whereas both TCP
and UDP uses 16 bit port numbers to identify communication endpoints. Thus
RPC programs can potentially outnumber protocol ports. Thus it is impossible
to map RPC program numbers onto protocol ports directly. More important,
because RPC programs cannot all be assigned a unique protocol port, programmers
cannot use a scheme that depends on well-known protocol port assignments.
Thus, at any given time, a single computer executes only a small number
of remote programs. As long as the port assignments are temporary, each
RPC program can obtain a protocol port number and use it for communication.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">If an RPC program does not use a reserved, well-known
protocol port, clients cannot contact it directly. Because, when the server
(remote program) begins execution, it asks the operating system to allocate
an unused protocol port number. The server uses the newly allocated protocol
port for all communication. The system may choose a different protocol
port number each time the server begins(i.e., the server may have a different
port assigned each time the system boots).</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The client (the program that issues the remote
procedure call) knows the machine address and RPC program number for the
remote program it wishes to contact. However, because the RPC program (server)
only obtains a protocol port after it begins execution, the client cannot
know which protocol port the server obtained. Thus, the client cannot contact
the remote program directly.</font>
<h3>
Dynamic Port Mapping</h3>
<font color="#000000">To solve the port identification problem,
a client must be able to map from an RPC program and a machine address
to the protocol port that the server obtained on the destination machine
when it started. The mapping must be dynamic because it can change if the
machine reboots or if the RPC program starts execution again.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">To allow clients to contact remote programs, the
Sun RPC mechanism includes a dynamic mapping service. The RPC port mapping
mechanism uses a server to maintain a small database of port mappings on
each machine. This RPC server waits on a particular port number (111) and
it receives the requests for all remote procedure calls.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Whenever a remote program (i.e., a server) begins
execution, it allocates a local port that it will use for communication.
The remote program then contacts the server on its local machine for registration
and adds a pair of integers to the database:</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(RPC program number, protocol port number)</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Once an RPC program has registered itself, callers
on other machines can find its protocol port by sending a request to the
server. To contact a remote program, a caller must know the address of
the machine on which the remote program executes as well as the RPC program
number assigned to the program. The caller first contacts the server on
the target machine, and sends an RPC program number. The server returns
the protocol port number that the specified program is currently using.
This server is called the <b><i>RPC port mapper</i></b> or simply the <b><i>port
mapper</i></b>. A caller can always reach the port mapper because it communicates
using the well known protocol port, 111. Once a caller knows the protocol
port number the target program is using, it can contact the remote program
program directly.</font>


<h3>RPC Programming</font></h3>
<font color="#000000">RPC Programming can be thought in multiple levels.
At one extreme, the user writing the application program uses the RPC library.
He/she need not have to worry about the communication through the network.
At the other end there are the low level details about network communication.
To execute a remote procedure the client would have to go through a lot
of overhead e.g., calling XDR for formatting of data, putting it in output
buffer, connecting to port mapper and subsequently connecting to the port
through which the remote procedure would communicate etc. The <b><i>RPC
library</i></b> contains procedures that provide almost everything required
to make a remote procedure call. The library contains procedures for marshaling
and unmarshaling of the arguments and the results respectively. Different
XDR routines are available to change the format of data to XDR from native,
and from XDR to native format. But still a lot of overhead remains to properly
call the library routines. To minimize the overhead faced by the application
programmer to call a remote procedure a tool named <b><i>rpcgen</i></b>
is devised which generates client and server stubs. The stubs are generated
automatically, thus they have loose flexibility e.g., the timeout time,
the number of retransmissions are fixed. The program specification file
is given as input and both the server and client stubs are automatically
generated by rpcgen. The specification file should have a .x extension
attatched to it. It contains the following information:-</font> </p>
<ul>

<li>
<font color="#000000">constant declarations ,</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">global data (if any),</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">information about all remote procedures ie.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">procedure argument type ,</font></li>

<li>

<font color="#000000">return type .</font></li>
</ul>
