Shortest Path Algorithm</h3>

<p><font size="4">1. Dijktstra's Algorithm:</font></p>

<dt>&nbsp;At the end each node will be&nbsp; labeled (see <i>Figure.1</i>) with its 
distance from source node along the best known path. Initially, no paths are 
known, so all nodes are labeled with infinity. As the algorithm proceeds and 
paths are found, the labels may change reflecting better paths. Initially, all 
labels are tentative. When it is discovered that a label represents the shortest 
possible path from the source to that node, it is made permanent and never 
changed thereafter. </dt>

<p>Look at the weighted undirected graph of&nbsp; <i>Figure.1(a)</i>, where the 
weights represent, for example, distance. We want to find shortest path from&nbsp; A 
to D. We start by making node A as permanent, indicated by a filled in circle. 
Then we examine each of the nodes adjacent to A (the working node), relabeling 
each one with the distance to A. Whenever a node is relabeled, we also label it 
with the node from which the probe was made so that we can construct the final 
path later. Having examined each of the nodes adjacent to A, we examine all the 
tentatively labeled nodes in the whole graph and make the one with the smallest 
label permanent, as shown in <i>Figure.1(b).</i> This one becomes new working 
node. </p>
<p>We now start at B, and examine all nodes adjacent to it. If the sum of the 
label on B and the distance from B to the node being considered is less than the 
label on the node, we have a shorter path, so the node is relabeled. After all 
the nodes adjacent to the working node have been inspected and the tentative 
labels changed if possible, the entire graph is searched for the tentatively 
labeled node with the smallest value. This node is made permanent and becomes 
the working node for the next round. The <i>Figure. 1</i> shows the first five 
steps of the algorithm. <br>

<p>Note: Dijkstra's Algorithm is applicable only when cost of all the nodes is 
non-negative.</p>

<p><font size="4">2. Bellman Ford's Algorithm:</font></p>

<p>We look at the distributed version which works on the premise that the 
information about far away nodes can be had from the adjoining links.</p>

<p>The algorithm works as follows. </p>

<ul>
  <ul>

    <li>Compute the link costs from the starting node to every directly 
    connected node . </li>
    <li>Select the cheapest links for every node (if there is more than one) .
    </li>
    <li>For every directly connected node, compute the link costs for all these 
    nodes. </li>
    <li>Select the cheapest route for any node . <br>
    Repeat until all nodes have been processed.</li>
  </ul>

</ul>
<p>Every node should have the information about it's immediate neighbors and 
over a period of time we will have information about other nodes. Within n units 
of time , where n is the diameter of the network, every node will have the 
complete information. We do not need to be synchronized i.e. do not need to 
exchange information at the same time.</p>

<p>Routing algorithms based on Dijkstra's algorithm are called Link State 
Algorithms. Distance Vector Protocols are based on distributed Bellman's 
algorithm. In the former we are sending little information to many nodes while 
in the latter we send huge information to few neighbors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>Count-to-Infinity problem:</i></b> <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img 
src="fig.lec25/count.gif" width="324" height="303">
</p>

<p>&nbsp; Suppose the link between A and E is down events may occur are: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) F tells A that it has a path to E with cost 6 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) A sets cost to E to be 11, and advertise to F again <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) F sets the cost to E to be 16, and advertise to A again </p>
<p>This cycle will continue and the cost to E goes to infinity. The core of the 
problem is that when X tells Y that it has a path somewhere ,Y has no way to 
know whether it itself is on the path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this process of counting to infinity, packets from A or F destined 
to E are likely to loop back and forth between A and F, causing congestion for 
other packets. </p>

<dt><b><font size="+1">Example to illustrate bad Routing Protocol :</font></b>
</dt>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font size="+1"> </font></b>Design of a bad routing protocol can 
lead to highly undesirable results. Consider the following scenario to 
understand this. We are having 16 nodes logically connected in a ring as shown 
in Figure1. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img 
src="fig.lec25/bad.gif" width="300" height="325">
<br>
</p>
<p>Each node sends one unit of data in unit time except one node Q which sends e 
(0&lt;e&lt;1) unit of data in unit time. We consider cost of the link as the traffic 
in that link. We consider P as the only receiver in the ring. Now Ideally we 
must have nodes left of the diagonal PQ sending data clockwise and that on the 
right of the PQ counterclockwise as shown in Figure 2. We may assume that Q 
sends data counterclockwise. Assume that this ideal distribution was achieved at 
some time. Now we can see that cost of links to the left of PQ are respectively 
1,2,3 ..,7 while that on the right of PQ are e,1+e,2+e ..,7+e. Therefore when we 
reconsider the shortest path the node immediately to the right of Q will see 
traffic 28 to the left while 28+7e to the right and therefore will start sending 
data clockwise and same is true for Q also. This will heavily change the traffic 
on the network. Now the traffic load will shift to the left of PQ and next 
reconsideration will make a lot of nodes from left of PQ send data 
counterclockwise. This may keep oscillating and will cost a lot to the network. 
To prevent these two steps can be taken : </p>

<p>1. Assign a minimum cost to each link. </p>
<p>2. Do not change the route until you get a significant advantage. </p>
