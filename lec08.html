<center><h2>Token Ring Network (Contd...)</h2></center><p>
<h3>
<b>Phase Jitter Compensation :</b></h3>
In a token ring the source starts discarding all it's previously transmitted
bits as soon as they circumnavigate the ring and reach the source. Hence,
it's not desirable that while a token is being sent some bits of the token
which have already been sent become available at the incoming end of the
source. This behavior though is desirable in case of data packets which
ought to be drained from the ring once they have gone around the ring.
To achieve the aforesaid behavior with respect to tokens, we would like
the ring to hold at least 24 bits at a time. How do we ensure this?
<p>Each node in a ring introduces a 1 bit delay. So, one approach might
be to set the minimum limit on the number of nodes in a ring as 24. But,
this is not a viable option. The actual solution is as follows.&nbsp; We
have one node in the ring designated as <b>"monitor"</b>. The monitor maintains
a 24 bits buffer with help of which it introduces a 24 bit delay. The catch
here is what if the clocks of nodes following the source are faster than
the source? In this case the 24 bit delay of the monitor would be less
than the 24 bit delay desired by the host. To avoid this situation the
monitor maintains 3 extra bits to compensate for the faster bits. The 3
extra bits suffice even if bits are 10 % faster. This compensation is called
Phase Jitter Compensation.

<h3><b>Handling multiple priority frames</b></h3>
Each node or packet has a priority level. We don't concern ourselves with
how this priority is decided. The first 3 bits of the Access Control byte
in the token are for priority and the last 3 are for reservation.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER WIDTH="20%" >
<tr>
<td WIDTH="12%">&nbsp;P</td>

<td WIDTH="12%">&nbsp;P</td>

<td WIDTH="12%">&nbsp;P</td>

<td WIDTH="12%">&nbsp;T</td>

<td WIDTH="13%">M</td>

<td WIDTH="13%">&nbsp;R</td>

<td WIDTH="13%">&nbsp;R</td>

<td WIDTH="13%">&nbsp;R</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Initially the reservation bits are set to 000. When a node wants to
transmit a priority n frame, it must wait until it can capture a token
whose priority is less than or equal to n. Furthermore, when a data frame
goes by, a station can try to reserve the next token by writing the priority
of the frame it wants to send into the frame's Reservation bits. However,
if a higher priority has already been reserved there, the station cannot
make a reservation. When the current frame is finished, the next token
is generated at the priority that has been reserved.
<p>A slight problem with the above reservation procedure is that the reservation
priority keeps on increasing. To solve this problem, the station raising
the priority remembers the reservation priority that it replaces and when
it is done it reduces the priority to the previous priority.
<p>Note that in a token ring, low priority frames may starve.

<h3><b>Ring Maintenance</b></h3>
Each token ring has a monitor that oversees the ring. Among the monitor's
responsibilities are seeing that the token is not lost, taking action when
the ring breaks, cleaning the ring when garbled frames appear and watching
out for orphan frames. An orphan frame occurs when a station transmits
a short frame in it's entirety&nbsp; onto a long ring and then crashes
or is powered down before the frame can be removed. If nothing is done,
the frame circulates indefinitely.
<ul>
<li><p><b>Detection of orphan frames:</b> The monitor detects orphan frames by setting
the monitor bit in the Access Control byte whenever it passes through.
If an incoming frame has this bit set, something is wrong since the same
frame has passed the monitor twice. Evidently it was not removed by the
source, so the monitor drains it.
<li><p><b>Lost Tokens:</b> The monitor has a timer that is set to the longest possible
tokenless interval : when each node transmits for the full token holding
time. If this timer goes off, the monitor drains the ring and issues a
fresh token.
<li><p><b>Garbled frames:</b> The monitor can detect such frames by their invalid
format or checksum, drain the ring and issue a fresh token.
</ul>
<p>The token ring control frames for maintenance are:<br><br>

<td WIDTH="25%">&nbsp;Standby monitor present</td>

<td WIDTH="61%">&nbsp;Announces the presence of potential monitors</td>
</tr>
</table></center>
<p>
The monitor periodically issues a message "Active Monitor Present" informing
all nodes of its presence. When this message is not received for a specific
time interval, the nodes detect a monitor failure.
Each node that believes it can function as a monitor broadcasts a "Standby
Monitor Present" message at regular intervals, indicating that it is ready
to take on the monitor's job.
Any node that detects failure of a monitor issues a "Claim" token. There
are 3 possible outcomes :
<ol>
<li>If the issuing node gets back its own claim token, then it becomes
the monitor.
<li>If a packet different from a claim token is received, apparently
a wrong guess of monitor failure was made. In this case on receipt of our
own claim token, we discard it. Note that our claim token may have been
removed by some other node which has detected this error.
<li>If some other node has also issued a claim token, then the node with
the larger address becomes the monitor.
</ol>
In order to resolve errors of duplicate addresses, whenever a node comes
up it sends a <b>"Duplicate Address Detection"</b> message (with the destination
= source) across the network. If the address recognize bit has been
set on receipt of the message, the issuing node realizes a duplicate address
and goes to standby mode.
A node informs other nodes of removal of a packet from the ring through
a <b>"Purge"</b> message.
One maintenance function that the monitor cannot handle is locating
breaks in the ring. If there is no activity detected in the ring (e.g.
Failure of monitor to issue the <b>Active Monitor Present</b> token...) , the
usual procedures of sending a claim token are followed. If the claim token
itself is not received besides packets of any other kind, the node then
sends <b>"Beacons"</b> at regular intervals until a message is received indicating
that the broken ring has been repaired.
<br>

<h3>
<b>Other Ring Networks</b></h3>
The problem with the token ring system is that large rings cause large
delays. It must be made possible for multiple packets to be in the ring
simultaneously. The following ring networks resolve this problem to some
extent :-
<p><b>Slotted Ring :</b>
<p>In this system, the ring is slotted into a number of fixed size frames
which are continuously moving around the ring. This makes it necessary
that there be enough number of nodes (large ring size) to ensure that all
the bits can stay on the ring at the same time. The frame header contains
information as to whether the slots are empty or full. The usual disadvantages
of overhead/wastage associated with fixed size frames are present.
<center>
<p><img SRC="fig.lec08/slottedr.gif"></center>

<p><b>Register Insertion Rings :</b>
<p>This is an improvement over slotted ring architecture. The network interface
consists of two registers : a shift register and an output buffer.
At startup, the input pointer points to the rightmost bit position
in the input shift register .When a bit arrives it is in the rightmost
empty position (the one indicated by the input pointer). After the node
has detected that the frame is not addressed to it, the bits are
transmitted one at time (by shifting). As new bits come in, they are inserted
at&nbsp; the position indicated by the pointer and then the contents are
shifted. Thus the pointer is not moved. Once the shift register has pushed out the last bit of a frame, it checks to see if it has an output frame waiting. In case yes, then it checks
that if the number of empty slots in the shift register is at least equal
to the number of bits in the output frame. After this the output connection
is switched to this second register and after the register has emptied
its contents, the output line is switched back to the shift register. Thus,
no single node can hog the bandwidth. In a loaded system, a node can transmit a k-bit frame only if it has saved up a k-bits of inter frame gaps.
<center>
<p><img SRC="fig.lec08/registerin.gif"></center>

<p>Two major disadvantages of this topology are complicated hardware and
difficulty in the detection of start/end of packets.

<h4>Contention Ring</h4>
<p>The token ring has primarily two problems:</p>
<ul> <li>On light loads, huge overhead is incurred for token passing. 
<li>Nodes with low priority data may starve if there is always a node with high
priority data. 
</ul>
A contention ring attempts to address these problems. In a contention ring, if there is no communication in the ring for a while, a sender node will send its data immediately, followed by a token. If the token comes back to the sender without any data packet in between, the sender removes it from the ring. However under heavy load the behavior is that of a normal token ring. In case a collision, each of the sending nodes will remove the others' data packet from the ring, back off for a random period of time and then resend their data.

<center><h2>IEEE 802.4: Token Bus Network</h2></center>
In this system, the nodes are physically connected as a bus, but logically form a ring with tokens passed around to determine the turns for sending. It has the robustness of the 802.3 broadcast cable and the known worst case behavior of a ring. The structure of a token bus network is as follows: 

<br><br><center><img src="fig.lec08/bus1.gif"></center><p>

<h3>Frame Structure</h3>
<center><img src="fig.lec08/frame.gif"></center><p>

<p>A 802.4 frame has the following fields:</p>
<ul><li>Preamble:  The Preamble is used to synchronize the receiver's clock.<br> 
<li>Starting Delimiter (SD) and End Delimiter (ED): The Starting Delimiter
and Ending Delimiter fields are used to mark frame boundaries. Both of them
contain analog encoding of symbols other than 1 or 0 so that they cannot occur
accidentally in the user data. Hence no length field is needed. <br>
<li>Frame Control (FC): This field is used to distinguish data frames from control frames. For data
frames, it carries the frame's priority as well as a bit which the destination
can set as an acknowledgement. For control frames, the Frame Control field is
used to specify the frame type. The allowed types include token passing and
various ring maintenance frames.<br>
<li>Destination and Source Address: The Destination and Source address fields may
be 2 bytes (for a local address) or 6 bytes (for a global address).<br>
<li>Data: The Data
field carries the actual data and it may be 8182 bytes when 2 byte addresses are used and 8174 bytes for 6 byte
addresses.<br>
<li>Checksum:  A 4-byte checksum calculated for the data. Used in error detection. </p>
</ul>
 
<h3>Ring Maintenance:</h3>
<h4>Mechanism:</h4>
<p>When the first node on the token bus comes up, it sends a <b>Claim_token</b> packet
to initialize the ring. If more than one station send this packet at the same
time, there is a collision. Collision is resolved by a contention mechanism, in
which the contending nodes send random data for 1, 2, 3 and 4 units of time
depending on the first two bits of their address. The node sending data for the
longest time wins. If two nodes have the same first two bits in their addresses,
then contention is done again based on the next two bits of their address and so
on.</p>
<p>After the ring is set up, new nodes which are powered up may wish to join the
ring. For this a node sends <b>Solicit_successor_1</b> packets from time to time,
inviting bids from new nodes to join the ring. This packet contains the address
of the current node and its current successor, and asks for nodes in between
these two addresses to reply. If more than one nodes respond, there will be collision.
The node then sends a <b>Resolve_contention</b> packet, and the contention is resolved
using a similar mechanism as described previously. Thus at a time only one node
gets to enter the ring. The last node in the ring will send a<b>
Solicit_successor_2</b> packet containing the addresses of it and its successor.
This packet asks nodes not having addresses in between these two addresses to
respond. </p>
<p>A question arises that how frequently should a node send a Solicit_successor
packet? If it is sent too frequently, then overhead will be too high. Again if
it is sent too rarely, nodes will have to wait for a long time before joining
the ring. If the channel is not busy, a node will send a Solicit_successor
packet after a fixed number of token rotations. This number can be configured by
the network administrator. However if there is heavy traffic in the network,
then a node would defer the sending of bids for successors to join in.</p>
<p>There may be problems in the logical ring due to sudden failure of a node.
What happens when a node goes down along with the token? After passing the
token, a node, say node A, listens to the channel to see if its successor either
transmits the token or passes a frame. If neither happens, it resends a token.
Still if nothing happens, A sends a <b>Who_follows</b> packet, containing the address
of the down node. The successor of the down node, say node C, will now respond
with a <b>Set_successor</b> packet, containing its own address. This causes A to set
its successor node to C, and the logical ring is restored. However, if two
successive nodes go down suddenly, the ring will be dead and will have to be
built afresh, starting from a <b>Claim_token</b> packet.</p>
<p>When a node wants to shutdown normally, it sends a <b>Set_successor</b> packet to
its predecessor, naming its own successor. The ring then continues unbroken, and
the node goes out of the ring.</p>

<h3>Priority Scheme:</h3>
<p>Token bus supports four distinct priority levels: 0, 2, 4 and 6.</p>
<p>0 is the lowest priority level and 6 the highest. The following times are
defined by the token bus:</p>
<ul>
<li>THT: Token Holding Time. A node holding the token can send priority 6 data
for a maximum of this amount of time. 
<li>TRT_4: Token Rotation Time for class 4 data. This is the maximum time a
token can take to circulate and still allow transmission of class 4 data.</p>
<li>TRT_2 and TRT_0: Similar to TRT_4. </ul>  
<p>When a station receives data, it proceeds in the following manner:</p>
<ul> <li>It transmits priority 6 data for at most THT time, or as long as it has
data.
<li>Now if the time for the token to come back to it is less than TRT_4, it
will transmit priority 4 data, and for the amount of time allowed by TRT_4.
Therefore the maximum time for which it can send priority 4 data is= Actual TRT
- THT - TRT_4
<li>Similarly for priority 2 and priority 0 data.</ul> 

<p>This mechanism ensures that priority 6 data is always sent, making the system
suitable for real time data transmission. In fact this was one of the primary
aims in the design of token bus.
