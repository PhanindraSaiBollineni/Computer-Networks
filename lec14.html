<h3>What is TCP?</h3>
<p align="left">TCP was specifically designed to provide a reliable end to
end    byte stream over an unreliable internetwork. Each machine supporting
TCP has    a TCP transport entity either a user process or part of the kernel
that manages    TCP streams and interface to IP layer. A TCP entity accepts
user data streams    from local processes, breaks them up into pieces not
exceeding 64KB and sends    each piece as a separate IP datagram. Client
Server mechanism is not necessary    for TCP to behave properly.</p>
<p align="left">The IP layer gives no guarantee that datagram will be delivered
  properly, so it is up to TCP to timeout and retransmit, if needed. Duplicate,
  lost and out of sequence packets are handled using the sequence number,
acknowledgements,    retransmission, timers, etc to provide a reliable service.
Connection is a must    for this service.Bit errors are taken care of by
the CRC checksum. One difference    from usual sequence numbering is that
each byte is given a number instead of    each packet. This is done so that
at the time of transmission in case of loss,    data of many small packets
can be combined together to get a larger packet,    and hence smaller overhead.</p>
<p align="left">TCP connection is a <i>duplex connection</i>. That means
there    is no difference between two sides once the connection is established.</p>

<h2><a name="connection"></a>TCP Connection establishment</h2>

<p>  The "three-way handshake" is the procedure used to establish a   connection.
 This procedure normally is initiated by one TCP and   responded to by another
TCP.  The procedure also works if two TCP   simultaneously initiate the procedure.
 When simultaneous attempt   occurs, each TCP receives a "SYN" segment which
carries no   acknowledgment after it has sent a "SYN".  Of course, the arrival
of   an old duplicate "SYN" segment can potentially make it appear, to the
  recipient, that a simultaneous connection initiation is in progress.   Proper
use of "reset" segments can disambiguate these cases.</p>
<p> The three-way handshake   reduces the possibility of false connections.
 It is the   implementation of a trade-off between memory and messages to
provide   information for this checking.</p>
<p>  The simplest three-way handshake is shown in figure below.  The   figures
should be interpreted in the following way.  Each line is   numbered for reference
purposes.  Right arrows (--&gt;) indicate   departure of a TCP segment from
TCP A to TCP B, or arrival of a   segment at B from A.  Left arrows (&lt;--),
indicate the reverse.   Ellipsis (...) indicates a segment which is still
in the network   (delayed). TCP states represent the state AFTER   the departure
or arrival of the segment (whose contents are shown in   the center of each
line).  Segment contents are shown in abbreviated   form, with sequence number,
control flags, and ACK field.  Other   fields such as window, addresses,
lengths, and text have been left out   in the interest of clarity.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p></p>
<pre>      TCP A                                                TCP B<br><br>  1.  CLOSED                                               LISTEN<br><br>  2.  SYN-SENT    --&gt; &lt;SEQ=100&gt;&lt;CTL=SYN&gt;               --&gt; SYN-RECEIVED<br><br>  3.  ESTABLISHED &lt;-- &lt;SEQ=300&gt;&lt;ACK=101&gt;&lt;CTL=SYN,ACK&gt;  &lt;-- SYN-RECEIVED<br><br>  4.  ESTABLISHED --&gt; &lt;SEQ=101&gt;&lt;ACK=301&gt;&lt;CTL=ACK&gt;       --&gt; ESTABLISHED<br><br>  5.  ESTABLISHED --&gt; &lt;SEQ=101&gt;&lt;ACK=301&gt;&lt;CTL=ACK&gt;&lt;DATA&gt; --&gt; ESTABLISHED<br><br>          Basic 3-Way Handshake for Connection Synchronisation<br><br></pre>

<p>  In line 2 of above figure, TCP A begins by sending a SYN segment   indicating
that it will use sequence numbers starting with sequence   number 100.  In
line 3, TCP B sends a SYN and acknowledges the SYN it   received from TCP
A.  Note that the acknowledgment field indicates TCP   B is now expecting
to hear sequence 101, acknowledging the SYN which   occupied sequence 100.
</p>
<p>  At line 4, TCP A responds with an empty segment containing an ACK for
  TCP B's SYN; and in line 5, TCP A sends some data.  Note that the   sequence
number of the segment in line 5 is the same as in line 4   because the ACK
does not occupy sequence number space (if it did, we   would wind up ACKing
ACK's!).<br>

</p>
<p>  Simultaneous initiation is only slightly more complex, as is shown in
  figure below.  Each TCP cycles from CLOSED to SYN-SENT to SYN-RECEIVED to
  ESTABLISHED.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p></p>
<pre>      TCP A                                            TCP B<br><br>  1.  CLOSED                                           CLOSED<br><br>  2.  SYN-SENT     --&gt; &lt;SEQ=100&gt;&lt;CTL=SYN&gt;              ...<br><br>  3.  SYN-RECEIVED &lt;-- &lt;SEQ=300&gt;&lt;CTL=SYN&gt;              &lt;-- SYN-SENT<br><br>  4.               ... &lt;SEQ=100&gt;&lt;CTL=SYN&gt;              --&gt; SYN-RECEIVED<br><br>  5.  SYN-RECEIVED --&gt; &lt;SEQ=100&gt;&lt;ACK=301&gt;&lt;CTL=SYN,ACK&gt; ...<br><br>  6.  ESTABLISHED  &lt;-- &lt;SEQ=300&gt;&lt;ACK=101&gt;&lt;CTL=SYN,ACK&gt; &lt;-- SYN-RECEIVED<br><br>  7.               ... &lt;SEQ=101&gt;&lt;ACK=301&gt;&lt;CTL=ACK&gt;     --&gt; ESTABLISHED<br><br>                Simultaneous Connection Synchronisation<br></pre>

<b>Question:</b> Why is three-way handshake needed? What is the problem if
we send only two packets and consider the connection established? What will
be the problem from application's point of view? Will the packets be delivered
to the wrong application?<br>
<p><u>Problem regarding 2-way handshake</u></br>
The only real problem with a 2-way handshake is that duplicate packets from a 
previous connection( which has been closed) between the two nodes might still be 
floating on the network. After a SYN has been sent to the responder, it might 
receive a duplicate packet of a previous connection and it would regard it as a 
packet from the current connection which would be undesirable.<br>
Again spoofing is another issue of concern if a two way handshake is used.Suppose
there is a node C which sends connection request to B saying that it is A.Now B sends
an ACK to A which it rejects & asks B to close connection.Beteween these two events
C can send a lot of packets which will be delievered to the application..</p>

<br>
The first two figures show how a three way handshake  deals with
problems of duplicate/delayed connection requests and duplicate/delayed connection acknowledgements
in the network.The third figure highlights the problem of spoofing associated with a two way handshake.
<p>
<b>Some Conventions</b><br>
1. The ACK contains  'x+1' if the sequence number received is 'x'.<br>
2. If 'ISN' is the sequence number of the connection packet then 1st data packet has the seq number 'ISN+1'<br>
3. Seq numbers are 32 bit.They are byte seq number(every byte has a seq number).With a packet 1st seq 
number and length of the packet is sent.<br>
4. Acknowlegements are cummulative.<br>
5. Acknowledgements have a seq number of their own but with a length 0.So the next data packet have the 
seq number same as ACK.<br>
<p>
<b>
Connection Establish</b></p>
<p><center><img border="0" src="fig.lec14/establish.conn.gif"> </center>
<ul>
<li>
The sender sends a SYN packet with serquence numvber say 'x'.
<li>The receiver on receiving SYN packet responds with SYN packet with sequence number 'y' and ACK with seq number 'x+1'
<li>On receiving both SYN and ACK packet, the sender responds with ACK packet with seq number 'y+1'
<li>The receiver when receives ACK packet, initiates the connection.
</ul>

<p><b>Connection Release</b></p>

<p><center><img border="0" src="fig.lec14/close.conn.gif"></center></p>
<ul>
  <li>The initiator sends a FIN with the current sequence and acknowledgement 
  number.</li>
  <li>The responder on receiving this informs the application program that it 
  will receive no more data and sends an acknowledgement of the packet. The 
  connection is now closed from one side.</li>
  <li>Now the responder will follow similar steps to close the connection from 
  its side. Once this is done the connection will be fully closed.</li>
</ul>
