<h3>Key Exchange in Symmetric Key Schemes (contd.)</h3>

<div align="left">
    In this lecture we will look at key exchange in symmetric key schemes where 
    public key encryption cannot be used. So the encryption using public and 
    private keys is not possible. We will see that in this scenario how do we 
    exchange the symmetric key. The two people who are communicating do not want 
    others to understand what they are talking about. So they would use a 
    language which others possibly do not understand. But they have to decide 
    upon a common language. For this the language has to be encrypted in some 
    key which will be somehow known to the other person.<p>Key exchange in 
    symmetric key schemes is a tricky business because anyone snooping on the 
    exchange can get hold of the key if we are not careful and since there is no 
    public-private key arrangement here, he can obtain full control over the 
    communication. There are various approaches to the foolproof exchange of 
    keys in these schemes. We look at one approach which is as follows:-</p>
    
<h3>Diffie - Hellman Key Exchange</h3>
    <p>A and B are two persons wishing to communicate. Both of them generate a 
    random number each, say x and y respectively. There is a function f which 
    has no inverse. Now A sends f(x) to B and B sends f(y) to A. So now A knows 
    x and f(y) and B knows y and f(x). There is another function g such that g(x,&nbsp; 
    f(y)) = g(y, f(x)). The key used by A is g(x, f(y)) and that used by B is 
    g(y, f(x)). Both are actually same. The implementation of this approach is 
    described below :</p>
    <p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="fig.lec34/31-diffie.gif" width="554" height="359"></p>
    <ol>
      <li>A has two large prime numbers <b>n </b>and <b>g</b>.<b> </b>There 
      are other conditions also that these numbers must satisfy. 
      <li>A sends <b>n, g and g<sup>x</sup> mod n </b>to B in a message. B 
      evaluates (<b>g<sup>x</sup> mod n)<sup>y</sup> </b>to be used as the key.
      <li>B sends <b>g<sup>y</sup> mod n </b>to A. A evaluates <b>(g<sup>y</sup> 
      mod n)<sup>x</sup></b> to be used as the key. So now both parties have the 
      common number <b>g<sup>xy</sup> mod n</b>. This is the symmetric (secret 
      communication) key used by both A and B now.&nbsp; 
</ol>    
  This works because though the other people know <b>n, g,</b> <b>g<sup>x</sup> 
      mod n, g<sup>y</sup> mod n </b>but still they cannot evaluate the key 
      because they do not know either x or y.
    
<h4>Man in the Middle Attack</h4>
    <p>However there is a security problem even then. Though this system cannot 
    be broken but it can be bypassed. The situation which we are referring to is 
    called the <b>man-in-the-middle attack</b>. We assume that there is a guy C 
    in between A and B. C has the ability to capture packets and create new 
    packets. When A sends <b>n, g and g<sup>x</sup> mod n, </b>&nbsp;C captures 
    them and sends <b>n, g and g<sup>z</sup> mod n </b>to B. On receiving this B 
    sends <b>n, g and g<sup>y</sup> mod n </b>but again C captures these and 
    sends <b>n, g and g<sup>z</sup> mod n </b>to A. So A will use the key <b>(g<sup>z</sup> 
    mod n)<sup>x </sup></b>&nbsp;and B will use the key <b>(g<sup>z</sup> mod n)<sup>y&nbsp;
    </sup></b>. Both these keys are known to C and so when a packet comes from 
    A, C decrypts it using A's key and encrypts it in it's own key and then 
    sends it to B. Again when a packet comes from B, it does a similar thing 
    before sending the packet to A. So effectively there are two keys - one 
    operating between A and C and the other between C and B.</p>
    <p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="fig.lec34/31-diffie_bug.gif" width="596" height="354"></p>
    
      There must be some solution to this problem. The solution can be such 
      so that we may not be able to communicate further ( because our keys are 
      different ) but atleast we can prevent C from looking at the data. We have 
      to do something so that C cannot encrypt or decrypt the data. We use a 
      policy that A only sends half a packet at a time. C cannot decrypt half a 
      packet and so it is stuck. A sends the other half only when it receives a 
      half-packet from B. C has two options when it receives half a packet :
      <ol>
      <li>It does not send the packet to B at all and dumps it. In this case 
      B will anyway come to know that there is some problem and so it will not 
      send it's half-packet.
      <li>It forwards the half-packet as it is to B. Now when B sends it's 
      half-packet, A sends the remaining half. When B decrypts this entire 
      packet it sees that the data is junk and so it comes to know that there is 
      some problem in communication. 
     </ol>
      Here we have assumed that there is some application level 
      understanding between&nbsp; A and B like the port number. If A sends a 
      packet at port number 25 and receives a packet at port number 35, then it 
      will come to know that there is some problem.
      At the very least we have ensured that C cannot read the packets 
      though it can block the communication. <p>There is another much simpler 
      method of exchanging keys which we now discuss :
      &nbsp;
      <h3>Key Distribution Center</h3> 
      There is a central trusted node called the Key Distribution Center ( 
      KDC ). Every node has a key which is shared between it and the KDC. Since 
      no one else knows A's secret key (<b>K<sub>A</sub></b>) KDC is sure that 
      the message it received has come from A. We show the implementation 
      through this diagram :
      <dd>
      <p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="fig.lec34/31-kdc.gif" width="448" height="471"></dd>
    
    <p>When A wants to communicate with B, it sends a message encrypted in it's 
    key to the KDC. The KDC then sends a common key to both A and B encrypted in 
    their respective keys. A and B can communicate safely using this key.
      There is a problem with this implementation also. It is prone to <b>
      replay attack</b>. The messages are in encrypted form and hence would not 
      make sense to an intruder but they may be replayed to the listener again 
      and again with the listener believing that the messages are from the 
      correct source. To prevent this, we can use:
      <ul>
      <li><b>Timestamps: </b>which however don't generally work because of the 
      offset in time between machines. Synchronization over the network becomes 
      a problem. </li>
      <li><b>Nonce numbers: </b>which are like ticket numbers. B accepts a 
      message only if it has not seen this nonce number before. </li>
      </ul>
